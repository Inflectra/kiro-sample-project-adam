# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an Online Library Management System that enables users to manage books, authors, and subjects in a digital library catalog.

The system provides comprehensive book management capabilities, user authentication, reporting functionality, and administrative features to support a complete library management workflow.
