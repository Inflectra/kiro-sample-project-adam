# Library Management System Design Document

## Overview

The Online Library Management System is a web-based application that provides comprehensive library catalog management with role-based access control. The system supports two primary user roles: borrowers (who can view catalogs and manage their checkouts) and librarians (who have full CRUD operations on books, authors, and subjects). The system includes advanced features such as barcode scanning, reporting capabilities, data visualization, and administrative functions for backup and data import.

## Architecture

### System Architecture Pattern
The system follows a **layered architecture** pattern with clear separation of concerns:

- **Presentation Layer**: Web-based user interface with role-specific views
- **Business Logic Layer**: Core application logic handling library operations
- **Data Access Layer**: Repository pattern for database operations
- **Database Layer**: Relational database for persistent storage

**Rationale**: This layered approach ensures maintainability, testability, and allows for future scalability. The separation enables different user interfaces to be added without affecting business logic.

### Technology Stack Considerations
- **Frontend**: Modern web framework supporting barcode scanning and interactive charts
- **Backend**: RESTful API architecture for clean separation between frontend and backend
- **Database**: Relational database to maintain data integrity and support complex queries
- **Authentication**: Session-based or token-based authentication system

## Components and Interfaces

### Core Components

#### 1. Authentication & Authorization Module
**Purpose**: Manages user login, session management, and role-based access control

**Key Interfaces**:
- `IAuthenticationService`: Handles user login/logout operations
- `IAuthorizationService`: Manages role-based permissions
- `IUserRepository`: Data access for user accounts

**Design Decision**: Separate authentication from authorization to allow for flexible permission systems and potential future integration with external identity providers.

#### 2. Book Management Module
**Purpose**: Handles all book-related operations including CRUD operations and catalog management

**Key Interfaces**:
- `IBookService`: Business logic for book operations
- `IBookRepository`: Data access for book entities
- `ICatalogService`: Manages book catalog and search functionality

**Design Decision**: Soft delete approach for book removal to maintain historical data and support audit trails, addressing Requirement 4.

#### 3. Author Management Module
**Purpose**: Manages author information and book-author relationships

**Key Interfaces**:
- `IAuthorService`: Business logic for author operations
- `IAuthorRepository`: Data access for author entities

**Design Decision**: Many-to-many relationship between books and authors to support co-authored works, addressing Requirement 6.

#### 4. Subject Management Module
**Purpose**: Handles subject categorization and book-subject associations

**Key Interfaces**:
- `ISubjectService`: Business logic for subject operations
- `ISubjectRepository`: Data access for subject entities

#### 5. Checkout Management Module
**Purpose**: Manages book borrowing, returns, and overdue tracking

**Key Interfaces**:
- `ICheckoutService`: Business logic for checkout operations
- `ICheckoutRepository`: Data access for checkout records
- `IBarcodeService`: Handles barcode scanning functionality

**Design Decision**: Separate checkout records from book entities to maintain borrowing history and support multiple checkouts of the same book over time.

#### 6. Reporting Module
**Purpose**: Generates reports and provides data visualization capabilities

**Key Interfaces**:
- `IReportService`: Business logic for report generation
- `IDataVisualizationService`: Handles chart generation and data presentation
- `IExportService`: Manages multiple export formats (HTML, Word, Excel, PDF)

**Design Decision**: Plugin-based export system to easily add new export formats without modifying core reporting logic.

#### 7. Administrative Module
**Purpose**: Handles system administration including backup, import, and user management

**Key Interfaces**:
- `IBackupService`: Database backup operations
- `IImportService`: External data import functionality
- `IUserManagementService`: User account administration

## Data Models

### Core Entities

#### User Entity
```
User {
  id: UUID
  username: string
  passwordHash: string
  role: UserRole (Borrower, Librarian, Administrator)
  createdAt: DateTime
  isActive: boolean
}
```

#### Book Entity
```
Book {
  id: UUID
  isbn: string
  title: string
  publisher: string
  publishedDate: DateTime
  barcode: string
  isActive: boolean (for soft delete)
  createdAt: DateTime
  updatedAt: DateTime
}
```

#### Author Entity
```
Author {
  id: UUID
  name: string
  contactInfo: string
  createdAt: DateTime
  updatedAt: DateTime
}
```

#### Subject Entity
```
Subject {
  id: UUID
  name: string
  description: string
  createdAt: DateTime
}
```

#### Checkout Entity
```
Checkout {
  id: UUID
  bookId: UUID
  borrowerId: UUID
  checkoutDate: DateTime
  dueDate: DateTime
  returnDate: DateTime (nullable)
  isOverdue: boolean (computed)
}
```

### Relationship Models

#### BookAuthor (Many-to-Many)
```
BookAuthor {
  bookId: UUID
  authorId: UUID
  authorOrder: int (for primary/secondary authors)
}
```

#### BookSubject (Many-to-Many)
```
BookSubject {
  bookId: UUID
  subjectId: UUID
}
```

**Design Decision**: Separate junction tables for many-to-many relationships provide flexibility for future enhancements like author ordering or subject weighting.

## Error Handling

### Error Categories
1. **Validation Errors**: Invalid input data, missing required fields
2. **Business Logic Errors**: Checkout conflicts, permission violations
3. **System Errors**: Database connectivity, external service failures
4. **Authentication Errors**: Invalid credentials, expired sessions

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Centralized Exception Handling**: Global error handler for consistent error responses
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues to function with reduced capabilities when non-critical services fail
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Technical errors translated to user-understandable messages
- **Audit Logging**: All errors logged with context for debugging and monitoring

**Design Decision**: Implement a hierarchical error handling system where business logic errors are handled at the service layer, while technical errors are handled at the infrastructure layer.

## Testing Strategy

### Testing Levels

#### 1. Unit Testing
- **Target**: Individual components and services
- **Focus**: Business logic validation, data transformation, edge cases
- **Tools**: Framework-appropriate testing libraries with mocking capabilities

#### 2. Integration Testing
- **Target**: Component interactions, database operations
- **Focus**: Repository implementations, service integrations
- **Approach**: In-memory database for fast, isolated tests

#### 3. End-to-End Testing
- **Target**: Complete user workflows
- **Focus**: Critical paths like book checkout, catalog search, report generation
- **Approach**: Automated browser testing for key user scenarios

#### 4. Security Testing
- **Target**: Authentication, authorization, data access
- **Focus**: Role-based access control, input validation, session management

### Test Data Strategy
- **Test Database**: Separate database instance with controlled test data
- **Data Seeding**: Automated test data generation for consistent testing
- **Cleanup**: Automated test data cleanup between test runs

**Design Decision**: Implement a comprehensive testing pyramid with emphasis on unit tests for business logic and integration tests for data access patterns, ensuring high confidence in system reliability.

### Barcode Integration Testing
- **Mock Barcode Scanner**: Simulate barcode input for automated testing
- **Barcode Validation**: Test various barcode formats and error conditions
- **Performance Testing**: Ensure quick response times for barcode scanning operations

This design addresses all requirements while providing a scalable, maintainable foundation for the library management system. The modular architecture allows for independent development and testing of components while maintaining clear interfaces between layers.
